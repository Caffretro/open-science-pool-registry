                        Within a minute, you should see a message in your
                        terminal that looks like
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>Token request approved!
Registration of source {{ source }} with {{ collector }} is complete!</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        If you don't, your computer was not able to confirm
                        that registration succeeded.
                        You may see an error message with more instructions
                        in that case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether your registration was confirmed or not,
                        continue following the instructions in your terminal.
