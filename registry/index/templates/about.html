                <h2>The HT Phenotyping Transfer Service</h2>

                <p>
                    Data transfers from data sources to storage and processing
                    servers are facilitated by
                    <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/">HTCondor</a>.
                    The HT Phenotyping project uses HTCondor to transfer data
                    in an automated, reliable, and secure manner.

                <h3 id="transfer-service-requirements">Requirements for using the Transfer Service</h3>

                <p>
                    To use the transfer service, you must have a
                    properly set-up computer to run the "client":
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The computer must be running of our support platforms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You must have administrative privileges on the computer.
                        For Ubuntu, this means you can run the
                        <code>sudo</code> command.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The computer should be powered on overnight
                        (synchronization is scheduled to occur nightly,
                        usually around midnight).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The computer should have a
                        reliable, high-speed internet connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The storage drive holding the data to be synchronized
                        should be connected to the computer at all times, and
                        should always be located at the same place in
                        the filesystem.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <div class="alert alert-warning">
                    The transfer service is resilient to short
                    power or internet outages, but you should take steps to
                    improve availability where possible
                    (for example, by powering the computer
                    from an uninterruptible power supply).
